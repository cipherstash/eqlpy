## Searchable encryption for Django and SQLAlchemy.

Based on the CipherStash [Encrypt Query Language (EQL)](https://github.com/cipherstash/encrypt-query-language),`eqlpy` provides a simple, type-driven approach to enabling encryption in your application.
By using EQL's built-in searchable encryption schemes, your model queries retain **full** search capabilities, including exact lookups, range queries, ordering and free text search.

## Features

- **Data type handling**: Supports various data types including integers, booleans, dates, floats, text, and JSONB.
- **Encrypted Search operations**: Search over encrypted data with no noticeable overhead.
- **Standard API**: Includes adapters for Django and SQLAlchemy.
- **Fast!**: Typical queries only incur a few milliseconds of overhead.

## Supported database packages

Currently, eqlpy supports either of the following database packages:

* psycopg 3 or psycopg 2
* sqlalchemy + psycopg 2
* Django + psycopg 2 (TODO: Yuji is this correct?)

For code examples of storing and querying encrypted data with [CipherStash Proxy](https://cipherstash.com/docs/getting-started/cipherstash-proxy) using those packages, refer to [examples directory](examples/) and [integration tests](tests/integration/).


## Installation

To install `eqlpy`, use the following command:

```bash
pip install eqlpy
```

You can find the latest version on the [Python Package Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.org/project/eqlpy).

TODO: How to install EQL itself?

## Usage with Django

### Defining an encrypted field

Let's say you have a customer model with an encrypted `name` field.
You can use the `EncryptedText` type when defining the field in the model:

```py
from django.db import models
from eqlpy.eqldjango import *

class Customer(models.Model):
    name = EncryptedText(table="customers", column="name")
```

The above customer model would create a database table like this:

```sql
CREATE TABLE myapp_customer (
    "id" bigint NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY,
    "name" cs_encrypted_v1 NOT NULL,
);
```

[!NOTE]
The column type in the database is `cs_encrypted_v1` which is encrypted type defined in [EQL](https://github.com/cipherstash/encrypt-query-language/blob/main/docs/reference/PAYLOAD.md). Internally EQL just uses JSON.

`eqlpy` supports many different data types, including numbers, dates and JSON.
See the [Reference](#) docs for more information.

### Inserting data

`eqlpy` automatically encrypts values when saving to the database.
You can interact with the Django model in the same way as you normally would.

```py
>>> customer = Customer(name="Fred Flintstone")
>>> customer.save()
```

When retrieving a record, `eqlpy` automatically decrypts the value using the credentials
defined in the setup step.

```py
>>> customer = Customer.objects.get(customer.id)
>>> customer.name
'Fred Flintstone'
```

TODO: Show what is contained in the database at this stage.

### Queries

Queries work much the same way in `eqlpy` - even though the data is fully encrypted!

For example, to find a record with a given name:

```py
Customer.objects.get(name__eq="Alice Developer")
```

Text search works slightly differently.
EQL doesn't define the `LIKE` operator, but instead uses an operator called `match`
which works in a similar way but over encrypted values.

```py
found = Customer.objects.get(name__contains="caro")
```

TODO: Link to a reference section
See the [Reference](#) docs for a full list of supported queries.

## Migrating to EQLPY

TODO


## Release

This project has been set up to use [Trusted Publisher](https://docs.pypi.org/trusted-publishers/) in PyPI from GitHub Actions.

To make a GitHub release and publish to PyPI do the following steps:

* Update the version in pyproject.toml in `main` branch (eg. "1.2.3")
* Make a tag of the same version prefixed with "v" (eg. "v1.2.3"), and push
  * `git tag v1.2.3`
  * `git push v1.2.3`
* `release-and-publish.yml` workflow will create a GitHub release, and publish the package to PyPI
